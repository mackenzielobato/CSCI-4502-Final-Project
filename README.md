# CSCI 4502 Final Project

These are all of the data files used in this project. They have been modified using MySQL Workbench in order to find companies that have positive funding rounds and to drop excess columns. Additionally, I uploaded the Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to perform the analysis. 

This project focused on where all of the venture dollars go in the United States. I used a 2013 Crunchbase data set sourced from Kaggle that initially contained 11 individual data sets which I then manipulated to the final csvs uploaded here.
